Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to learn patterns from data. 
It is widely used in various applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. 
Supervised learning and unsupervised learning are two main types of machine learning.
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to process complex data.
