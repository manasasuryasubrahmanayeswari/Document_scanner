Machine learning and artificial intelligence are revolutionizing different fields.  
They enable computers to analyze data and make informed decisions without direct programming.  
Supervised learning requires labeled datasets, whereas unsupervised learning finds patterns autonomously.  
Deep learning uses artificial neural networks to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets.
