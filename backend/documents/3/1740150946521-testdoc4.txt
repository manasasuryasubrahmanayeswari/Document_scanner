Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data. 
It is widely applied in areas such as image processing, natural language understanding, and recommendation engines. 
Supervised learning and unsupervised learning are two fundamental approaches in machine learning.
Deep learning is an advanced form of machine learning that relies on neural networks to analyze data.
