Artificial intelligence and machine learning are transforming various industries.  
These technologies allow systems to learn from data and make decisions with minimal human intervention.  
Supervised learning involves labeled data, while unsupervised learning identifies patterns without predefined labels.  
Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, relies on neural networks for processing and decision-making.
